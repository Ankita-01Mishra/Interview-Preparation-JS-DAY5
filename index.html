    <h2>JS Interview Preparation Day 5</h2>
    <h3>1. what is Hoisting?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-->  Hoisting is a process where interpreter appears in JS to move the declaration at the top of the code .
                Due to hoisting variable with var can be accessible before declaration with a default value undefined.  
                let and const is also hoisted in the TDZ , TDZ prevents browser to access before initialization.
                function with name is hoisted
                function expression and class expression is not hoisted.     
    </pre>
    <h3>2. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-->  The satring of the execution block in which the let and const is declared,till the variable is initialized,called TDZ of the variable.
            Variables with let and const are hoisted in temporal dead zone, which prevents them being accessible.      
    </pre>
    <h3>3. What is DOM</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents a document as a tree of objects.
            It allows you to manipulate the content and structure of document by mosifying the properties of these objects.       
    </pre>
    <h3>4. Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> Passed by value means value will be passed to a function as a copy means if we change anything inside the function, it will not effect the original function.
                    function increment(x){
                        x++;
                    }
                    let y=5;
                    increment(y);
                    console.log(y);    
            Passed by reference means reference will be passed to a function as an argument of the original function rather than the copy . It means if we change any thing in the function,original value will also be changed.
                function increment2(obj){
                    obj.value++
                }
                let obj={value:100}
                increment2(obj)
                console.log(obj.value);            
    </pre>
    <h3>5.Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> map() applies to a given function on each element of the array and returns a updated array.
            arr=[2,3,4,5]
            const newArr=arr.map(n=>n*2)
            console.log(newArr);//[4,6,8,10]  
            filter method takes each element of an array and applies conditional statement against it. If the condition returns true  then operation will take place 
            arr=[2,3,4,5]
            const newEvenArr=arr.filter(item=>item%2==0)
            console.log(newEvenArr); //[2,4]
            
    </pre>
    <h3>6.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-->i) To make the readable
            ii) To make a better approach then callback or promise
           iii) Error handling is simplier
            iv)Debugging is easier       
    </pre>
    <h3>7.Give an example of async/await</h3>
    <pre>
function setTimeoutPromise(delay) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (delay < 0) return reject("Delay must be greater than 0")
  
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(`You waited ${delay} milliseconds`)
      }, delay)
    })
  }
  doStuff()
  async function doStuff() {
    const msg1 = await setTimeoutPromise(1000)
    console.log(msg1)
    console.log("First Timeout")
  
    const msg2 = await setTimeoutPromise(2000)
    console.log(msg2)
    console.log("Second Timeout")
  }        
    </pre>
